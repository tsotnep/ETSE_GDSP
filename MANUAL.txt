-Always work in bash shell, no need to use cshell, u can give cshell scripts as an argument to the tools, from bash shell.


-Connect one micro-usb into UART, another one into PROG ports of zedboard zynq 7000.


-Before doing anything, in each script in folder src/tcl/ manually change
  1."origin" variable, LINE 1,
  2.location of xilinx tools "settings64.sh" -file, LINE 2


-Exact commands on how to execute each script is written in THE script, LINES 2 and 3.


-No need to worry from which directory you execute the script.


-order of scripts to execute to program and interface with FPGA:
  1.src/tcl/build_ip_ETSE_GDSP.tcl
  2.src/tcl/build_project_ETSE_GDSP_DMA_ETHERNET.tcl
  3.src/tcl/build_app_ETSE_GDSP_DMA
  4.connect to UART by (to exit: ctrl+x+q): \picocom -e x -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
  5.src/tcl/program_fpga_BITSTREAM_APP.tcl
  6.enter "33" in picocom terminal, that will send specific command to MMULT IP. or enter "0" for IP manual.
  7.for next calculation, start from step 5.





-IF you get this error while programming the fpga:
  "Error :: ERROR:
          Failed to claim JTAG Device 1 for debug. Check if it's
          in use by other client for debug"
  Then execute:
    killall hw_server


-IF xsct/sdk does not launch after 60 seconds and gives you error on that, type:
  for bash shell:
    export SWT_GTK3=0 && export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
  for c shell
    setenv SWT_GTK3 0 && setenv LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8
