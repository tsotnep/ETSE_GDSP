You need to use only those two in this folder.

- generate_matlab_results_with_octave.py -to generate results of matrix multiplication, from octave (octave is similar to matlab)

- compare_matlab_vhdl_results.py -to compare octave/matlab results with *vivado simulation results


Differences between hdl simulation and actual values are inside folder "diff"

*vivado simulation results can be obtained by executing script : src/tcl/simulate_ip_ETSE_GDSP.tcl, manual of using it, is inside the script.
